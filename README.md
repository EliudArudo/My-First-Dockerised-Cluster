> Docker Swarm version
### Build Setup
``` bash
#  Make sure you have Docker installed
# Clone the repo, and in the home dir of the cloned repo, run

$ docker-compose up
```

1. Build Setup for Locked Swarm with one way in through nginx server
``` bash
#  First initialise your 'Swarm'
$ docker swarm init

# Deploy swarm from home directory
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yaml <stack-name>

# Check logs from a Swarm service
# add '--follow' to trace logs
$ docker service logs <service-name>
```

2. Build a multi-node cluster
``` bash
# In your local machine - make sure you have 8GB RAM and above
# For windows
$ docker-machine create --driver hyperv --hyperv-virtusl-switch <your-virtual-switch> <node-name>

# ssh into your created vm
$ docker-machine ssh <node-name>

# Initialise your docker swam, and use join tokens to add nodes
$ docker swam init
# Promote a worker from your leader node
$ docker node update --role manager <node-name>

# Create our overlay networks, eg 'frontend', 'backend'
$ docker network create --driver overlay <network-name>

# Add services to the networks
# Note, assign right environment variables to each service as in docker.stack.yaml
# Node, aliases are important when using nginx, or env variables such as MONGODB=mongodb
# Important, open up port to front end services only
# Follow the docker.stack.yaml schematics for this - env variables and aliases are most important, + ports to frontend services

$ docker service create --name <service-name> -p 80:80 --alias <alias-name> --network <network-name> -e <env-variables>=<env-value> -e <env-variables>=<env-value> <image>

# Check processes running in a service
$ docker service ps <service-name>

# Update config of the services, eg, add replicas/ scale up/down a service
$ docker service update <service-name> --replicas=<number>

# Clear all our services
$ docker service rm <service-1> <service-2> ...

# Leaving is tricky for managers, as they have our credentials, so we have to demote them first
$ docker node demote <manager-node>

# Then they can leave - veryone has to leave to clear
$ docker swarm leave

# Then we as the Leader, can remove them
$ docker node rm <node-name>

# Get out of ssh'ed server 'Ctrl + D'

# Delete the nodes in case of local env
$ docker-machine rm <node-name>

```

>  Kubernetes version
### Set up your environment to run 'kubectl'

1. First instantiate the Ingresses from 'Initial Ingress Setup'


2. Start with the Generic mandatory setup (in the home directory)

```
$ kubectl apply -f 'Initial Ingress Setup/Generic Deployment'
```

3. Then appy setup the LoadBalancing service for development purposes

```
$ kubectl apply -f 'Initial Ingress Setup/Local Dev Ingress'
```

4. Then run all the cluster configs in 'k8s' folder
```
$ kubectl apply -f k8s
```

From here, you can access the apps from 'http://localhost:80'
